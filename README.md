# Smart Mirror (IOT project)

The goal of this project was to use regular house hold objects(like mirror, led bulbs etc) to notify user of an incomming notification and help user with anxiety caused by FOMO.

This project is written in python. 
The information retrived by the hub and will be transmited via bluetooth to the connected IOT devices.

In our case, for POC we were using a 16*2 Green LCD display to show the user info.
Email was retrieved using imap library in python and fed into serial port.
Rss was read via minidom structure of rss feeds provided by most of the websites.

Got a 9.5 on 10 for this ðŸ˜Ž
